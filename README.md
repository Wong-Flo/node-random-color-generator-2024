# node-random-color-generator-2024

## Create

Create an application that will return a random color in the command line.

It should work like this:

When a user enters node index.js in the command line, a block of 31x9 # characters colored with a random color (using hex code, e.g. #ff0000) should be generated.

In addition to node index.js, it should also be able to accept the request for a:

hue (eg. green or red or blue)
luminosity (eg. light or dark)
...and then generate random colors that match those choices.
